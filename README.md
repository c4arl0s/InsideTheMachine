# INSIDE THE MACHINE

## 1 Basic Computing Concepts.

At the heart of the modern computer is the microprocessor â€”also commonly called the central processing unit (CPU)

## The calculator Model of Computing

A computer takes a stream of instructions (code) and a stream of data as input, and it produces a stream of results as output.

## The File-Clerk Model of Computing

In the file-clerck model, the computer accesses a large store of sequentially arranged numbers for the purpose of altering that store to achieve a desired result. Once this desired result is achived, the computer halts so that the now-modified store of numbers can be read and interpreted by humans.

## The stored-Program Computer

All computers consist of at least three fundamental types of structures needed to carry out the read-modify-write sequence:

- Storage.
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Bus.

Figure 1.3

Prior to the invention of the first stored-program computer, all computing devices, from the abacus to the earliest electronic computer machines, had to be manipulated by an operator or group of operators who manually entered a particular sequence of commands each time they wanted to make a particular calculation.

## Refining the File-clerck Model.

All computers operate.

Example

1.- obtain two numbers to be added (the input operands) from the data storage.
2.- Add the numbers.
3.- Place the results back into data storage.

Those three steps are carried out billions of times per second on a modern CPU.


## The register file

Most computers have a relatively small number of very fast data storage locations attached to the ALU, these locations ara called registers.

Backing to the example.

1.- Obtain the two numbers to be added (the input operands) from the two source registers.
2.- Add the numbers.
3.- Place the results back in a destination register.

This three-step sequence is quite simple, but it's at the very core of how a microprocessor really works.

## The File-Clerck MOdel Revised and Expanded

We can think of main memory as a document storage room located on another floor and the registers as a small.
The clerk does not really know anything about the document storage room
